Growing up, I always found myself drawn and tied to my computer. I've always been fascinated by the fact that we held the power to make things appear and move on our screens. Thus, over the years I've played around with various programming languages in attempts to create things of my own which would manipulate what happens on my computer screen. Because of this, I've known for a long time I wished for a career involving computers. With this, I naturally found myself looking to Software Engineering as the most suitable path for me to take. As I've already known for years that I thouroughly enjoy coding and learning how to code, thanks to my own personal projects in the past. That being said, by studying Software Engineering I could have a formal education in the field, and have the ability to turn something I already love to do into a professional career. That, is why I decided to study Software Engineering.
